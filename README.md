# Compound-Mongoose-Coffeescript API Boilerplate

## A Node.js API boilerplate

Based on
1. [CompoundJS](https://github.com/1602/compound) (1.1.7-9) - views and assets were removed to maintain a slim api-oriented paradigm
2. [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) as MongoDB database adapter
3. Implemented in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)

This boilerplate for API implementation is based on CompoundJS (1.1.7-9), integrated with Mongoose as database adapter and initialized using CoffeeScript. View and assets components were removed to keep it slim and API-oriented.
